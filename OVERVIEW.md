# Senzing Rust SDK Overview

The Senzing Rust SDK provides safe, idiomatic Rust bindings to the Senzing Entity Resolution Engine. This SDK enables developers to integrate powerful entity resolution capabilities into Rust applications with type safety and memory safety guarantees.

## Core Capabilities

### Entity Resolution
- **Add Records**: Store entity data from various sources
- **Search Entities**: Find similar entities using fuzzy matching
- **Resolve Entities**: Automatically merge related records
- **Why Analysis**: Understand why entities were linked or not linked

### Configuration Management
- **Data Sources**: Register and manage multiple data sources
- **Entity Types**: Define different types of entities (Person, Organization, etc.)
- **Features**: Configure matching features (names, addresses, phones, etc.)
- **Rules**: Set up resolution and relationship rules

### System Operations
- **Performance Diagnostics**: Monitor and optimize system performance
- **Database Management**: Handle database initialization and configuration
- **Version Information**: Access product and license details

## Example Use Cases and Prompts

### Getting Started
```
"Help me set up a basic Senzing Rust project that can add customer records and find duplicates"

"Show me how to initialize the Senzing environment and add my first entity record"

"I need to search for entities by name and email - what's the simplest way to do this?"
```

### Data Integration
```
"I have customer data from multiple systems - how do I register different data sources?"

"Help me load records from a CSV file into Senzing for entity resolution"

"Show me how to handle errors when loading bad data records"
```

### Search and Resolution
```
"I need to find all entities that might be the same person based on partial information"

"How do I get detailed resolution information showing why two records were linked?"

"Show me how to search for entities and get confidence scores for matches"
```

### Configuration Management
```
"I need to add a new data source for employee records - walk me through the process"

"Help me configure custom matching rules for my specific entity types"

"Show me how to export and import Senzing configurations"
```

### Performance and Monitoring
```
"My entity resolution is running slowly - help me diagnose performance issues"

"I need to benchmark my Senzing setup - show me how to run performance tests"

"How do I monitor memory usage and optimize for large datasets?"
```

### Database Operations
```
"I need each test to use its own isolated database - how do I set this up?"

"Help me migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better performance"

"Show me how to backup and restore my Senzing database"
```

### Error Handling and Debugging
```
"I'm getting SENZ3121 errors - help me debug what's wrong with my data format"

"My application crashes on certain records - show me proper error handling patterns"

"Help me trace through why a specific entity resolution decision was made"
```

### Advanced Features
```
"I need to implement real-time entity resolution for streaming data"

"Help me set up bulk loading for millions of records efficiently"

"Show me how to integrate Senzing with my existing authentication system"
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Initialization Pattern
```rust
// Standard initialization for applications
let env = ExampleEnvironment::initialize("my-app")?;
let engine = ExampleEnvironment::get_engine_with_setup(&env)?;

// Custom initialization with specific settings
let settings = r#"{% raw %}{"PIPELINE":{"CONFIGPATH":"/etc/opt/senzing",...}}{% endraw %}"#;
let env = SzEnvironmentCore::new("my-app", &settings, true)?;
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```rust
match engine.add_record("CUSTOMERS", "CUST001", record_json, None) {
    Ok(result) => println!("Record added: {}", result),
    Err(SzError::Engine { message, code, .. }) => {
        eprintln!("Engine error {}: {}", code, message);
    }
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Other error: {}", e),
}
```

### Resource Management Pattern
```rust
fn process_entities() -> SzResult<()> {
    let env = ExampleEnvironment::initialize("processor")?;
    let engine = ExampleEnvironment::get_engine_with_setup(&env)?;

    // Do work...

    // Automatic cleanup when env goes out of scope
    ExampleEnvironment::cleanup()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Common Development Workflows

### Adding New Entity Types
1. Register data source: `config.register_data_source("NEW_SOURCE")?`
2. Add entity type configuration if needed
3. Test with sample records
4. Validate resolution behavior

### Performance Optimization
1. Run diagnostic tests: `cargo run --example check_datastore_performance`
2. Analyze bottlenecks
3. Adjust batch sizes and threading
4. Monitor memory usage

### Testing Strategy
1. Use isolated databases for each test
2. Test error conditions explicitly
3. Verify resolution logic with known test cases
4. Performance test with realistic data volumes

## Integration Patterns

### Web Applications
- Initialize Senzing once at application startup
- Use connection pooling for concurrent requests
- Implement proper error responses for API endpoints
- Cache frequent search results appropriately

### Batch Processing
- Use bulk loading for large datasets
- Implement checkpointing for long-running jobs
- Monitor progress and handle partial failures
- Optimize batch sizes based on available memory

### Real-time Systems
- Initialize components once and reuse
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience
- Use async patterns where appropriate
- Monitor latency and throughput metrics

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Always use `?` operator for proper error propagation
- Match on specific error types, not error messages
- Provide meaningful context in error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### Resource Management
- Clean up test databases after each test
- Use RAII patterns for automatic cleanup
- Monitor memory usage in long-running applications
- Implement proper shutdown procedures

### Configuration
- Use environment variables for deployment-specific settings
- Validate configuration at startup
- Document required vs optional settings
- Provide sensible defaults for development

### Testing
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use realistic test data
- Verify expected resolution behavior
- Test performance with representative data volumes
