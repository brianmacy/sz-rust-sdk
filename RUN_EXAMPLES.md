# Running All Examples

This directory contains scripts to run all Senzing Rust SDK examples for testing and verification purposes.

## Scripts

### `run_all_examples.sh`
Runs all examples quietly with just pass/fail status. Good for quick verification.

```bash
./run_all_examples.sh
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Runs all 28 examples
- ⏰ 30-second timeout per example
- 📊 Summary report with pass/fail counts
- 🔇 Silent execution (no output from examples)
- 🚀 Fast execution for CI/testing

### `run_all_examples_verbose.sh`
Runs all examples with full output. Good for debugging issues.

```bash
./run_all_examples_verbose.sh
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Runs all 28 examples
- ⏰ 30-second timeout per example
- 📋 Full output from each example
- 🐛 Detailed error information
- 📊 Comprehensive summary report

## Example Output

### Silent Mode
```
=== Running All Senzing Rust SDK Examples ===
Found 28 examples to run

[1/28] Running: basic_usage
  ✅ PASSED: basic_usage

[2/28] Running: complete_workflow
  ✅ PASSED: complete_workflow

...

=== SUMMARY ===
Total examples: 28
Passed: 26
Failed: 2

🎉 All examples completed successfully!
```

### Verbose Mode
Shows full compilation and execution output for each example, making it easy to debug any issues.

## Use Cases

### Development Testing
```bash
# Quick check after code changes
./run_all_examples.sh

# Debug specific issues
./run_all_examples_verbose.sh
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# In CI pipeline
./run_all_examples.sh || exit 1
```

### Memory Error Detection
Both scripts help identify:
- Memory leaks
- Double free errors
- Segmentation faults
- Infinite loops (via timeout)
- Compilation errors

## Exit Codes

- `0` - All examples passed
- `1` - One or more examples failed or timed out

## Requirements

- Rust toolchain
- Senzing SDK installed at `/opt/senzing/er/`
- All project dependencies (`cargo build` should work)
