//! Delete Via Loop Example
//!
//! This example demonstrates batch deletion of records using a loop with
//! error handling, progress tracking, and retry logic. It shows how to
//! efficiently delete multiple records with proper monitoring.
//!
//! Rust equivalent of: deleting/DeleteViaLoop/Program.cs
